# Response

## My priority:

### Early User Feedback
* For Creator
  - 1.(Creator) My statistics don't seem to match up with my dashboards on individual apps.
  - 2.(Creator) I want more insight into what my fans respond the most to.
  - 3.(Creator) I want to use digital rewards to incentivize my community to engage with my content.
  - 4.(Creator) I want to understand how my community compares to others.

* For Fan
  - 1.(Fan) I changed my handle but my profile still lists my old one.
  - 2.(Fan) I want to be prompted about actions I could take that would improve my standing on the leaderboard.
  - 3.(Fan) When viewing a leaderboard, I want to see my own placement in the middle of the table
  - 4.(Fan) When viewing a leaderboard, I want to see movement / activity so that it feels more interactive and live.
